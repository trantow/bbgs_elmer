Elmer/Ice code for the Bering-Bagley Glacier System Model

Provided by Thomas Trantow as required by paper submission to Computer & Geosciecnes. See the relevant Paper titled "Sensitivity of Glacier Elevation Analysis and Numerical Modeling to CryoSat-2 SIRAL Retracking Techniques".

An example Solver Input File (SIF) to run the BBGS model in Elmer/Ice is provided (crev\_BBGS\_C2\_swath\_IAMG\_20181126.sif) along with code the BBGS-specific User Functions (USF\_Bering.f90). Code was written by Thomas Trantow and adapted from open source code provided by the Elmer/Ice community (see http://elmerice.elmerfem.org/courses-tutorials).
